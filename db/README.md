### `timesheet_full_script.sql`

A combined version that integrates the steps from the scripts of the SYS and the user, allowing:

- Full setup from scratch  
- Easier deployment in controlled environments

> ðŸ›  **Note:** The lines responsible for creating the **tablespace** and **user** are **commented out by default**.  
> If you wish to execute the script in **Oracle PL/SQL Developer**, make sure to **uncomment** those lines as needed.

Use this for testing or automated setup where SYS access and user-level actions are executed in sequence.
